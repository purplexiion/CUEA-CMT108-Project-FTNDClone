<img class="Founders"src="Snapchat-1088044015.jpg" alt="The Picture of the Founder of Diamika">
<span class="main-header">THE INCEPTION</span>
    <p>Founder : Wamuyu Wachira</p><br>
    <p class="FounderInfo">Diamika was founded by Wamuyu Wachira, a student of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa, through a web development project for her class(CMT 108). 
      Initially to serve as a Kenyan Styled F.T.N.D Clone (Fight the New Drug - an non-profit organization that educates people on the effects of pornography 
      and sex trafficking), she realized that apart from Pornography addiction, there are others that have not been touched on or they are disregarded. 
      Hence Diamika was formed from two words Diamond and Amka
which when put together, shows that in order for someone to be of value to society, like a diamond, one must wake up and decide that they are going to be changemakers.</p>
<br>
<span class="main-header">OUR GOAL AS DIAMIKA</span>
<h1>See our fellow youth free from the shackles of addiction</h1>
<p>Our youth today fail to be the best they are because they are being held back by such addictions and since, even though highly normalized in our culture,they face stigma when opening around such issues affecting them. Diamika is promising to help our youth be their best selves and be free from the shackles of whatever addiction they may be suffering from.</p>
<br>
<p>According to Caminorecovery and other sources, the top ten addictions affecting people, especially the youth include:</p>
